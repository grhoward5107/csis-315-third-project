      <p>What is a life coach? According to the author of Brilliant Life Coach (2012), a life coach is "a way of providing you with all the information and tools that you need for your success and personal development" (p.xiv). Based upon this observation, this type of coach helps people throughout their life by physical and factual means. These means are meant to change a person's outlook on life so that he or she can help himself or herself and those around them. In the Christianity, the best life coach that a Christian can have is the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus helps the community of Christian believers through the morals of His parables, His life example by serving others over Himself, and by providing Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of the world. In order for the Christian believer to be part of the Christian family, he or she must believe that God the Father sent His Son to the world so that He may live a perfect life and die a sinner's death as the penalty for his or her sins in this world. After Jesus died, He rose again on the third day and gave the Holy Spirit to the apostles so that the Gospel can be spread to the ends of the world. Once the Gospel reaches the corners of the Earth, the Great Commission is fulfilled.
          
      <p>Back to the profession of a life coach, Lionnet (2012) illustrates the profession to a different type of coach, "life coaching supports and encourages you throughout the process in the same way as a sports coach coaches an athlete to perform at their optimum before and during a game"(p.xiv). In this example, an athlete is comparable to a life client of a life coach. The reason that a life client and an athlete are comparable to each other is because both kinds of people need to develop a daily routine and a positive attitude. The difference between a life client and an athlete is the goal that he or she wants to achieve. The goal of an athlete is to win a sport game for his or her team. Whereas a life client's goal is to improve their outlook on life through different means of self development. Based upon the life client's life struggle, the means of transformation can be physical, mental, physiological, psychological, relational, or another type of harm that leads to either self harm or a negative outlook on life. The person that becomes a life client needs to be transformed by his or her coach through the coach finding his or her client's purpose in life so that he or she can find a purpose to fulfill in this world. When that purpose is found, the negative or harmful outlook on life can be changed to a positive or productive outlook on life.</p>
     
     <p>One way that a life coach can help his or her client find purpose is by allowing him or her to take back control of their life. Lionnet (2012) agrees with this observation by making observations of her own, "but more often than not we feel unequal to the task of taking control and directing the course of our own lives. When you doubt your ability to make decisions concerning your own well-being and happiness you fail to thrive and left feeling dependent and powerless"(p.3). In other words, the negative or harmful outlook on life comes to someone mentally through his or her decisions being directed by others instead of making their own decisions on their life. Once a person takes back control of his or her life, then the decisions that he or she makes are based upon their character instead of societal pressures. A life coach can help life clients in other ways, but to find out more about life coaches. He or she needs to hire one.</p>
